This repository contains load testing projects for an eCommerce application using Gatling. It showcases examples in both Java (using Maven), Javascript (using NPM), and  TypeScript (using NPM). The application under test is hosted at [https://ecomm.gatling.io](https://ecomm.gatling.io).

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use Gatling for load testing an eCommerce application, providing examples in two languages:

- Java with Maven: Leverages the Gatling Maven Plugin for executing load tests.
- Scala with SBT: Leverages the Gatling SBT Plugin for executing load tests.

## Project Structure

- `/java`: Contains the Java project setup for load testing using Maven. See the Java README for details on setup and execution.
- `/scala`: Contains the Scala project setup for load testing using SBT. See the Scala README for instructions on prerequisites and usage.
- `/postman`: Contains the Postman project setup for load testing using `javascript` & `typescript`. See the Postman README for instructions on prerequisites and usage.

## Application Under Test

The eCommerce application used for testing is hosted at [https://ecomm.gatling.io](https://ecomm.gatling.io). It serves as the target application for our load testing scenarios, simulating realistic user interactions.
